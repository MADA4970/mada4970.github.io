    <h3 id="Canto-One">Canto One</h3>
    <pre>
    Born of a scalding light - a conflux of worlds should be entwined
    
    Brought into wild being from a tempest of stars
    
    Behold: The Convergence
    
    Lodestone of unruly harmonies
    
    Bathed in wondrous and chaotic possibility
    
    Where lost memories might be reclaimed and rekindled
    
    Where generations of orphaned threads shall find their tapestry
    
    Where old prejudices shall crack and crumble
    
    Beside the warmth of clement culture and nascent unities
    
    From the tragedies of the past new understandings shall be illuminated
    
    From the poisoned mind: the seed of beauty shall bud and foster new compassions
    
    From the unyielding demon of time: new pathways shall be untwined and charted
    
    From the ashy rocks of an immolated world: vibrant histories shall be preserved
    
    From the warrens of unending greed and disproportion: community shall thrive
    
    from the doomed and icy steppes frozen for a thousand years: flowers shall bloom
    
    New life, rooted in the acrid soil of the past, reaching for the sunlight of tomorrow
    
    And Woe:
    
    It shall all be forgotten
    </pre>

<h3 id="Canto-Two">Canto Two - Origin of the Mindsplitter</h3>
<pre>
    In the blackest depths of the cosmos his loneliness was born
    
    To only the company of his parents' cheerful lullabies
    
    Echoing off the hull plates of the research vessel
    
    and their frozen bodies in the cargo hold
    
    Kept from unthinkable agony. Crowned into a kingdom of siren slumber
    
    That when the tragic prince awoke, he yearned madly to return
    
    To his kingdom that never was
    
    Forgetter-sent from the heartless void of space to rend all soft things asunder
    
    Prisoner of dreams, incarcerator of thought, eraser of being
    
    The Mindsplitter
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Three">Canto Three - Origin of the Glimmer</h3>
<pre>
    Even ages ago, there it shone: a twisting fissure of brilliance, blazing in the sky
    
    The Glimmer blinding all desires, but the procurement of its shine
    
    The siren promise of such light is not so easily forgotten
    
    The Y'ruk heard the call of the Glimmer, and forged an answer
    
    A grand megastructure was erected from the crag, like a hand yearning for touch
    
    Up they built, absorbing all their civilization had into this tower, all but their ambition
    
    for what unimagined wonders lay patient for the climbers, beyond this perilous summit
    
    With each step higher, the heedless Y'ruk grew more transfixed by the Glimmer
    
    With each ascending moment, they lost one more memory of their lives before the climb
    
    But oh, the irony such teetering possibilities belie
    
    The hard-ground realization of the falling figure:
    
    The brightest promises are often lies
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Four">Canto Four - From the Ashes, the Lineage Begins</h3>
<pre>
    And as the Y'ruk fell from the Glimmer's siren glare, their planet opened up in rage:
    
    Spewing its burning innards; scorching the land; swallowing the living for their hubris
    
    The survivors fled into darkness, never 'gain to see their suns: the age of Ossuary begun
    
    In this darkness the lineage of librarians was born: with Lyra, first speaker of the stones
    
    Thus followed Laqiqal, who would make greater the capacity to encapsulate things past
    
    Thus followed The Caretaker, who helped the crags remember kindness
    
    Thus followed Eliphas, who would enable the stone to recall the realm of dreams
    
    Thus followed Max Beta, who would usher memory from antiquity to modernity
    
    Thus followed Yarmles Ackerslag, misuser of memory, and shamer to the lineage
    
    Thus followed Ripple, whose remembering brought balance to the old ways and the new
    
    The lineage of librarians tolled for generations to preserve the past
    
    But the stones spoke of a great light coming to erase the world of all its memories
    
    And of a child who could illuminate the path to save them
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Five">Canto Five - Origin of Ruin</h3>
<pre>
    A half-born child named Rune shall find the prophecy inlaid in these dark pages
    
    Shall glimpse the time-twisted warning of our dire fate, to be forgotten
    
    Shall grasp the single leaf of paper upon which our future depends
    
    Shall set the sacred stone into its mantle
    
    Shall turn solid rock into a rippling ocean of time
    
    Shall retrieve this Tome of Forgetting from its ageless reliquary
    
    Thereupon, Rune and three entangled pairs shall unify In Convergence
    
    Shall be holding all and hidden from all, together
    
    Shall one day bestow this Tome to the time-spun traveler
    
    They who hold the key - the past needed to secure the future we remember
    
    Fabled savior of our memories - shouldst they complete their endeavor
    
    Lest the Mindsplitter tear open his gateway to the Glimmer
    
    And all that's wondrous here be forgot forever
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Six">Canto Six - A Fragile Convergence is Born</h3>
<pre>
    Hark the ecstatic clamor! Following in their wake!
    
    Hark the Convergence of Worlds!
    
    And what salvation this brave confluence shall be
    
    For four worlds on the brink, near the end of their eras
    
    They shall have the tender warmth of another chance
    
    Wrapped by the glow of new love, new beginnings, and new joy
    
    There shall be joy of the cantor, who hears his lost opus sung beautifully by a friend
    
    The joy of time spun lovers, who shall fall in love for the first time, all over again
    
    The joy of the scribe- who discovers her own words written in a stranger's hand
    
    Or the joy of the broken family, given a second chance to mend
    
    Oh! Such marvelous new colors shall be woven into this tapestry of life!
    
    As feelings mysterious, new and old, rebalance along the eager abacus of their hearts
    
    Hand in capable and considerate hand, they shall rebuild a freer and kinder world
    
    And what they have lost of their lives before, they shall remember together
    
    A motley and abundant communion, before the altar of change
    
    But such intricate and nascent possibilities, due to their very nature
    
    Shall be ever fragile, and vulnerable to the malign
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Seven">Canto Seven - Eye of the Mindsplitter</h3>
<pre>
    Alas, this Convergence shall bring no remedy to the Mindsplitter
    
    The wild confluences and creations searing his ambitions like salt in the wound
    
    For what salvation does he search in the ether clouds of his mind?
    
    He shall see a flicker of light slip through his grasp
    
    And the Glimmer will consume him
    
    He shall reason away the dissolution his desire inflicts on these worlds
    
    If only his bright destination would bring him the solace he thought promised
    
    In the nascent Convergence lay opportunity for his bleak direction
    
    And so these worlds will fade away until not one memory remains
    
    Into a wasteland, crafted from the barren planes of the intangible
    
    The Mindsplitter shall trade all days away for tomorrow's glory
    
    And as we are subsumed, we shall forget what a day ever was
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Eight">Canto Eight - The Forgetting of the City</h3>
<pre>
    A blinding light will subsume C Street, the light of the great forgetting
    
    Every vibrant sight of the city shall split, into shards of a fearful and uncanny dream
    
    Every surface once grained with habitual suppleness, now shall scald and scrape
    
    Every flavor once savory or succulent shall taste putrid or of rot
    
    Every aroma once alluring, shall reek carbolic and foul
    
    The clangs and notes that once echoed adventure off the city walls, these too shall spoil
    
    The once wondrous din of C Street, shall degenerate into a harrowed wall
    
    And once the light has dissolved all familiar things, the people shall forget themselves
    
    Citizens shall pour into the streets as their memories pour out from their minds
    
    frantically searching the disambiguating city for their loved ones and children,
    
    Only in the madness, to forget which children were theirs.
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Nine">Canto Nine - The Forgetting of the Caves</h3>
<pre>
    The new age of Ossuary, shall utter a final and irreversible cry
    
    Deep underground the great forgetting shall cause the dust to settle in permanence
    
    And the Y’ruk, molded in perseverance, shall watch the curtain fall on their civilization
    
    There will be no more pasts to preserve, truths to behold, or dreams to bestow
    
    All connections will disintegrate, ever to be estranged in the consuming void
    
    The memories cradled in Ossuary's rocky embrace will be eradicated
    
    Twisting and crumbling stone will lay no new paths, only waste
    
    Sisters will look upon brothers with blank faces like hollow masks unworn
    
    The winding catacombs, once illuminated, will be cast into eternal darkness
    
    The Oss rock, once thought worthless, will see this ill perspective realized
    
    The life giving fungi of the caverns, no longer understood, will act as poison in the vein
    
    The walls will no longer echo with the ancient songs, but with the shrieks of the dwellers
    
    fear will grip the hearts of those who remain until, in a whisper, they too fade
    
    Unburned will be this plot of rock, this forgotten tomb swallowed by eternity
    
    There shall be no memories to preserve and no one left to preserve them
    
    The sanctuary of knowledge will collapse into withered nihil
</pre> 
<h3 id="Canto-Ten">Canto Ten - The Forgetting of the Ice</h3>
<pre>
    The coldest Eemian winter shall be that of the great forgetting
    
    And with its baleful winds, they shall lose not only their families but their way of life
    
    Their grand cathedral shall crumble, as they forget its hallowed purpose
    
    Their celestial songs shall be forgotten to silence, never to be sung again
    
    The greatest pang of loss shall be that which, even in one thousand years of ice.
    
    The Eemians had never once let go of: hope
    
    For even the stars, that long told their history and their future
    
    Shall be emptied of meaning, their sacredness untethered
    
    Every constellation shall taunt down from oblivion
    
    For there can be no path back, to a home
    
    If there be no home remembered
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Eleven">Canto Eleven - The Forgetting of the Earth</h3>
<pre>
    One day the great forgetting, unbiased in its havoc, shall reap Earth of its essence
    
    The passing down of stories will be no more and the poetry of life shall be erased
    
    None will recount the beauty that unfolded upon the beautiful blue emerald
    
    Emptied will be the minds of humans who wove meaning into the world around them
    
    Now severed from greater context and contemplation of their purpose
    
    The bells will ring once more as their towers buckle under burning splinters
    
    Though it is not a song of rejoice, but a dirge of desolation
    
    At once displaced and stationary these empty vessels will line the shores
    
    Pleading to remember, grasping for understanding
    
    But the waves will bring only water and the time of remembering will have passed
</pre>
<h3 id="Canto-Twelve">Canto Twelve - The Mindsplitter’s Future</h3>
<pre>
    And beyond the blinding light of his gateway, his hands seize a new day:
    
    Tilling the wasted planes of melted bodies: drained of history, culture, memory - all
    
    Crushing the husks of their emptied lives, he sculpts the morass into a throng of puppets
    
    Feeding them only his poisonous lies. He molds their soft minds like potter's clay
    
    Coddling his stolen kin, as if he'd been not their undoer, but their loving father
    
    Oh, how madly the ruined dance to his crooked songs of fortune!
    
    A billion mindless marionettes, strung together feebly
    
    By the strands of a beautiful world undone
    
    ***
    
    His Future hath arrived
</pre>
    <h3 id="Canto-Thirteen">Canto Thirteen - The Traveler</h3>
<pre>
    But there lies a solitary chance that these worlds will not be lost to oblivion
    
    For a Traveler will come, who with their hand might still this trembling domain
    
    Though their destination will be cloaked in obscurity, it will be obtainable
    
    The path they forge may spring salvation for the people of these withered worlds
    
    That the minds of those erased may resuscitate with clarity and zeal
    
    So cling with purpose to that which makes you whole
    
    As all vibrance is devoured by the blinding void, lend hope to this mysterious Traveler
    
    Their hand shall awaken Convergence, and the dawn of remembrance will rise eternal
