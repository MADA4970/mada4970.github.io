        <h3>I had bigger aspirations at first but I couldn't find an "I Think You Should Leave" quote API. I could have used scraping methods but I ran out of time. My original idea was to get the quotes from the show and then translate them into Spanish as a fun way to learn the language. Instead I just used the api we used in class and a language translation API to give the question in spanish which is still a fun way to learn. The API is called MyMemory Translation API. I tried to use LibreTranslate at first but they require a subscription</h3>
